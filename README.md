<h>PHP Pool (21 School Project)</h>

PHP Pool is a project for those who wants to learn PHP (as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript) form the very beginning. It consists of daily projects (each of them may include up to 20 small tasks).
All pdf-files with tasks are in the appropriate folders (check files named dxx.en.pdf where xx is the number of day starting with 00).
